# Ant2XML
Ant is an open source build tool (a tool dedicated to the assembly of the different pieces of a program) from the Apache Software Foundation. Ant is the most commonly used build tool for Java programs. Maven is another build tool created by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an extension of Ant because ant Tasks can be used in Maven. The difference from Ant is that a project can be reusable. This example describes a transformation from an Ant file to Maven files (project.xml and maven.xml).
